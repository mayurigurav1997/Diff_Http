2)Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2HTTP 1.1
1.Keeps all request and response in plain text format.
2.HTTP1.1. is slower and not efficient as compare to the HTTP 2
3.Introduce in 1997
4.Internet landscape was constantly changing with websites becoming more dynamic and heavy
5.Features like CORS, keep alive was introduced in this update
6.HOL-Head of Line Blocking
TCP connection gets blocked till the response is received.
6 TCP connections are allowed but that not sufficient
7.Repetation of Header data
stateless connection-every request/response is independent of previous request/response
so with each request header contains user-agent, cookie, cache-control.
This header data cant compress
8.For each request new TCP connection is created so keep alive option introduce which enables re-using of the same TCP connection for multiple HTTP request.

HTTP 2.0
1.Uses binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary fromat
2. HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1
3. In HTTP/2, the binary framing layer encodes requests/responses and cuts them up into smaller packets of information, greatly increasing the flexibility of data transfer.
4.Introduce in 2015
5.Uses single TCP connection with multiple streams. establishes a single connection object between the two machines. Within this connection there are multiple streams of data. Each stream consists of multiple messages in the familiar request/response format. Finally, each of these messages split into smaller units called frames
Not required multiple TCP connections
6.HTTPS is must
7.Used HPACK
Each request don’t contain Header again and again
Header data is separate from request data and can e zipped
HPACK also enables reuse of Header data which is repeated in every request
HPACK reduces HTTP request size
8.PUSH frames enables us to send mandatory resources in advance along with HTTP response like JS,CSS
9.All modern web server supports HTTP2


3)Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects are variable which can contain many values
Object values are written in name:value pair
Name:”Mayuri”;  //Name is key or property or attribute or member_variable
var Resume={ 
            name:"Mayuri Gurav",                                             //Normal Object
